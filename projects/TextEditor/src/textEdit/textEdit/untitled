hello world.
this terminal works like the one from vmin however, 
the backspace doesn't work as you would think (it gives too many spaces)
and you have to use the up, down, left and right
arrows in order to navigate this text editor. 
the delete button works but needs a bit more work.
the insert button on the physical computer is not working yet since it inserts a capital K.
to save file ,Esc key to go into 'Normal mode'. (that's the initial screen)
to exit , first go to 'normal mode' and then press 'x'. the status will let you know what mode 
you are in.
